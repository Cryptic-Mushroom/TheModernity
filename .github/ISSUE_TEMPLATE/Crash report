Only report crashes that are caused by the Modernity! Before reporting, please check if the crash happens without the Modernity. If so: DO NOT REPORT IT HERE!!!!

Explain the crash:
- What crashes?
- How to reproduce the crash?
- Server or client?
- Does it happen with only the Modernity installed?

Be clear and concise. 

#### Crash report
```
Paste the crash report here: make sure it is in this code block! 
You may paste the crash report in a gist or pastebin: make sure you remove this code block then.
When the game crashes, the launcher will probably show you a button to open the crash report (old launchers just show the crash report itself).
```

If you have some screenshots or recording, please include them. They are very helpful to understand the issue.

If you have found some remarkable log messages, please include them (in a code block or a gist).

Vague or duplicate crashes are ignored and closed so be clear and check if your issue does not exist already!

#### Environment
- Modernity: [modernity version]
- Forge: [forge version]
- Did you use other modpacks, mods, resource packs or data packs, consider listing them here too (the crash report also shows them though).
