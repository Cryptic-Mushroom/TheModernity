Explain the bug:
- What isn't working?
- How to reproduce the problem?
- Does the game crash? How?

Be clear and concise.

If you have some screenshots, please include them. They are very helpful to understand the issue.

If this is about a crash, please paste the crash report here (in a code block!!). When the game crashes, the launcher will probably show you a link to open the crash report (old launchers just shows the crash report itself).

If you have found some remarkable log messages, please include them (in a code block or a gist).

Vague or duplicate issues are ignored and closed!

#### Environment
- Modernity: [modernity version]
- Forge: [forge version]
- Did you use other modpacks, mods, resource packs or data packs, please list them here too.
