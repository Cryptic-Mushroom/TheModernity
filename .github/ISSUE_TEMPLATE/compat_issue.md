Before reporting, make sure that the Modernity behaves incorrectly and not the other mod! Compare against other mods!

Explain the issue:
- What isn't working?
- How to reproduce the problem?
- Which other mods are involved? How?

Be clear and concise.

If you have some screenshots, please include them. They are very helpful to understand the issue.

If you have found some remarkable log messages, please paste them here (in a code block!!!). Include complete log files in a GIST or PASTEBIN, and do not include a DEBUG log unless we ask for it!!!

Vague or duplicate issues are ignored and closed!
