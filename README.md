# The Modernity <small>_A mod by Red Galaxy_</small>
The Modernity is a mod for Minecraft 1.13.2, developed by Red Galaxy. This new but expansive mod adds a completely new
dimension to Minecraft (and even more dimensions in the future) with a lot of new exiting content.

The Modernity dimension is a dark and mysterious world where the ancient forces of nature fused into a modern network of
natural intelligence... In this world live the remnants of ancient civilization that suffered from an angry curse that
diffused all over the network, now having the control of the complete world...

Features will include (some are not yet implemented):
- A complete new survival experience
- A whole new dimension to survive in
- A plethora of new blocks to build with
- Lots of new items to use and craft with
- Rations of new biomes and structures to explore
- Lots of new mechanics
- And so much more...
