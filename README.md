# The Modernity
### _A mod by Red Galaxy_
The Modernity is a mod for Minecraft 1.13.2, developed by Red Galaxy. This new but expansive mod adds a completely new dimension to Minecraft (and even more dimensions in the future) with a lot of new exiting content.

The Modernity dimension is a dark and mysterious world where the ancient forces of nature fused into a modern network of natural intelligence... In this world live the remnants of ancient civilization that suffered from an angry curse that diffused all over the network, which now has the control over the complete world... Only a strong and tough person with a fresh soul could save the world.

Features will include (some are not yet implemented):
- A complete new survival experience
- A whole new dimension to survive in
- A plethora of new blocks to build with
- Lots of new items to use and craft with
- Rations of new biomes and structures to explore
- Lots of new mechanics
- And so much more...
