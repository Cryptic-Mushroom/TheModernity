# Nature's Debris - formerly The Modernity
### _A mod developed by Red Galaxy_

---

**Nature's Debris is being renamed from it's old name 'The Modernity'!!! It can be a bit confusing, as in the current stages it has two names. Remember: Nature's Debris is already the official name, but The Modernity may still refer to this mod. I strongly encourage everyone updating the name of the mod whereever they have it as soon as possible, AS THERE WILL EVENTUALLY BE A NEW MOD ASSIGNED TO THE OLD NAME! _PLEASE DO THIS TO AVOID CONFUSION!!!_<br>
I'm updating all the names where I can as soon as I can, and it might cause some things not to work for a while. The currently released versions will persist under the old name but get archived as soon as I release a new update.<br>
More on the rename later, and I'm very sorry if I already confused you with this: I'm ready to discuss all your points and answer all your questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YvyzTFf).**

**Thanks!**

Nature's Debris is a mod for Minecraft 1.14.4, developed by Red Galaxy. This new but expansive mod adds a completely new dimension to Minecraft (and even more dimensions in the future) with a lot of exiting content.

Nature's Debris' universe is a dark and mysterious world where the ancient forces of nature fused into a network of natural intelligence... In these worlds live the remnants of ancient civilization that suffered from an angry curse that diffused all over the network, which now has the control over the complete universe... Only a strong and tough person with a fresh soul can save the universe.

Features will include (some are not yet implemented):
- A complete new survival experience
- A whole new dimension to survive in
- A plethora of new blocks to build with
- Lots of new items to use and craft with
- Rations of new biomes and structures to explore
- Lots of new mechanics
- And so much more...
