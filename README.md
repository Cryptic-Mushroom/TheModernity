# The Modernity
### _A mod under the Cryptic Mushroom banner, developed by Red Galaxy_
The Modernity is a mod for Minecraft 1.14.4, developed by Red Galaxy. This new but expansive mod adds a completely new dimension to Minecraft (and even more dimensions in the future) with a lot of exiting content.

The Modernity universe is a dark and mysterious world where the ancient forces of nature fused into a modern network of natural intelligence... In these worlds live the remnants of ancient civilization that suffered from an angry curse that diffused all over the network, which now has the control over the complete universe... Only a strong and tough person with a fresh soul can save the universe.

Features will include (some are not yet implemented):
- A complete new survival experience
- A whole new dimension to survive in
- A plethora of new blocks to build with
- Lots of new items to use and craft with
- Rations of new biomes and structures to explore
- Lots of new mechanics
- And so much more...

## Cryptic Mushroom
On April 8th, this project was moved under the banner of the Cryptic Mushroom modding group. **A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE SOON!!!**

## In Development
The mod is currently in beta phase. There is enough content to play with but things are still incomplete and may not work like expected. The mod is available as build on GitHub and CurseForge...
