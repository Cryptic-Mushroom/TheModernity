The Modernity is a completely different, but parallel universe that's hidden in background. Connections between this universe have existed for thousands of years, though they weren't really known. Until one day, when life approved that the Modernity had to exist and was completely habitable. Life slowly filled this universe, and due to differences in physics laws, life was able to grow much larger than it ever could in the normal universe.

Inhabitants of the Modernity were strong and powerful. They discovered technologies that were originally impossible and they learned how they could be used. They were always curious about the limits of their universe and how far they could go beyond. But as powerful as they were, the nature around them seemed to be way more powerful than they thought. It was stronger, it was smarter. And there was no way to stop it.

But one day, a group of researchers had a theory. The only way to go beat nature's power was to go back to the other universe, back to Earth. And they did so. But unknown to them, traveling the reverse direction was unstable and brought it's consequences. Back on Earth, they were unable to hande the different, limited physics. Their souls got corrupted (nowadays known as Endermen). The last connections between the two universes were destroyed and the Modernity got flooded with a dark, unstoppable curse. All life got corrupted, all peace got destroyed, and humanity was gone forever. The universe was lost forever.

Years passed by...

Centuries passed by...

Until someone, one with a fresh soul, was finally able to get the curse under control...
